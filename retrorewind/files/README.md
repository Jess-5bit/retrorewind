ABOUT
Retro Rewind is an arcade-inspired website where users can play retro-style games directly in their browser. The site is responsive on both desktop and mobile devices. The website has been tested on Computer, Ipad, Iphone and Laptop and works smoothly. Featuring a neon aesthetic and a nostalgic vibe, this project brings classic gaming to the modern web.

CODE
HTML5 - Structure and content
